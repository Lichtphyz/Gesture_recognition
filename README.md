### Classification of Gestures from SmartWatch Accelerometer Data

Jul 2017 â€“ Aug 2017

Used snippets of smartwatch accelerometer data to identify one of 20 gestures. This required generating all features from the accelerometer data. Achieved 98% recognition accuracy on the dataset using both individual and ensemble models, if permitted to train on some of a user's previous actions; and 88% accuracy for users the system has never seen before.
